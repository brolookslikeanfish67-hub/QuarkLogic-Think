## Overview
FarSkip-Collective models modify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to enable native communication-computation overlap while achieving performance comparable to the original MoE architecture.
By significantly reducing exposed communication overhead, the architecture unlocks higher hardware utilization for sparser and larger MoE architectures on GPUs.
This repo is based on the research described in [FarSkip-Collective: Unhobbling Blocking Communication in Mixture of Experts Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11505).

FarSkip models modify the dependency graph of the MoE transformer block and use partial and outdated activations as the input to the MoE sub-blocks, which allows for overlapping of MoE communication.
The accuracy of the FarSkip-Collective architecture has been validated for large-scale MoEs at the 100B+ parameter scale and with large-scale pre-training ablations.

We provide separate implementations for optimized training and inference below. The training is implemented with the [Primus](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Primus) framework + MegatronLM backend and follows the details in Primus `dev/farskip` branch [link](https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Primus/tree/dev/farskip).
The inference engine is implemented with SGLang and follows the setup we describe below.

For training, we provide overlapped and reference implementations for FarSkip-Collective. The main implementation is the optimized overlapped implementation that enables communication overlapping in the forward and backward passes.
The reference implementation is used for debugging and prototyping. When activating deterministic sub-layer paths, the reference and overlapped implementations result in bit-exact forward passes.



## Setup (Inference)
1. Pull the LMSYS AMD SGLang Docker image (MI30x / MI325x machines)
```bash
docker pull lmsysorg/sglang:v0.5.6-rocm700-mi30x # sha256:1e4030610e482c9f09c29309b223d2ad1f1ed4c56c2e00d5c352f5673a860770
```
2. Start Interactive Docker Container
```bash
IMAGE_NAME=lmsysorg/sglang:v0.5.6-rocm700-mi30x
docker run \
    -it \
    --rm \
    --network=host \
    --ipc=host \
    --privileged \
    --device=/dev/kfd \
    --device=/dev/dri \
    --device=/dev/infiniband \
    --group-add video \
    --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE \
    --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
    --shm-size 200G \
    -v $HOME:$HOME \
    --name 'sglang_env' \
    $IMAGE_NAME \
    /bin/bash
```

## Usage
Under the `inference` directory we provide SGLang implementation of FarSkip.
### Single-node
For a single-node inference test with DeepSeek-V3 modified with FarSkip-Collective connectivity, inside the Docker container, run:
```bash
cd "/path-to-farskip/inference/" # TODO replace with correct path
MODE=FARSKIP bash scripts/benchmark_farskip_deepseek_v3.sh
```
Here `MODE` controls the architecture path used with the following options.

| FLAG                       | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MODE=FARSKIP`             | Enables FarSkip-Collective model connectivity and communication-computation overlap implementation                                                 |
| `MODE=FARSKIP_REFERENCE`   | Enables FarSkip-Collective model connectivity with a simpler reference implementation without communication-computation overlap (used for testing) |
| `MODE=OFF`                 | Regular DeepSeek-V3 model architecture inference (original path)                                                                                   |


### Multi-node
In addition to the single-node setup, on each node install the relevant NIC drivers inside the container depending on your cluster's NIC drivers (e.g., Mellanox, Broadcom, etc.). 
For multi-node launching we need to set `MASTER_ADDR` and `RANK` on each node before running.

For a 2-node test with DeepSeek-V3 modified with FarSkip-Collective connectivity, inside the Docker container on each node, run:
```bash
# rank=0
RANK=0 MASTER_ADDR=<node0_ip>:<port> MODE=FARSKIP bash scripts/multinode_benchmark_farskip_deepseek_v3.sh

# rank=1
RANK=1 MASTER_ADDR=<node0_ip>:<port> MODE=FARSKIP bash scripts/multinode_benchmark_farskip_deepseek_v3.sh
```

### Additional details
For debugging purposes to test the `DeepseekV2FarSkipDecoderLayer` and `DeepseekV2ReferenceFarSkipDecoderLayer` decoder classes, you may set `FARSKIP_DISABLE_CONNECTIVITY=1`.
This will still use the new corresponding FarSkip decoder classes but with the regular model connectivity which nullifies FarSkip (you can find more details under `deepseek_v2.py`).
